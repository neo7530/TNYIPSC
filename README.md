# TNYIPSC (coming soon)
MOTOTRBO &lt;=> HBLink Gateway


This is a tiny gateway software to connect a Motorola DMR Repeater (like MOTOTRBO DR-3000) directly to a FreeDMR compatible DMR Server. (HBLink, MMDVM-Protocol)

Data / Voice / SDS / Talker-Alias / D-APRS supported - bidirectional.

Just download TNYIPSC for your desired platform, edit the config for your needs and run the software.

- In unlicensed mode you'll be able to connect your Repeater to a HBLink Network and listen to any conversation.
- The reverse way will be enabled by licensing the software with a license key.
- also the program will refuse to work in daemon-mode and exites after 15 minutes in unlicensed mode.
